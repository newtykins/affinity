# Welcome to Affinity (:

Let's discover **Affinity in less than a minute**.

![](banner.png)

## What is Affinity?

Affinity is a wrapper for the [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/) API which aims to make using it as simple as possible. It does this by wrapping the data with many useful classes, while still providing you the flexibility of access to the raw data.

## How do I get started?

To get started, install Affinity from NPM by running `npm i affinity-osu`, and begin reading [the tutorial](tutorial/authentication.md) in which you will create a useful tool to rank you and your friends in terms of pp!

#### NOTE

This tutorial is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), and assumes you can understand at least some TypeScript. TypeScript specific features will be annotated and avoided as much as possible, and you can still use all of Affinity's features in vanilla JavaScript.
